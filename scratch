# Commands
--export-by-date: export into a folder structure of YYYY-MM-DD (you can fully customize the export structure using the --directory option, see the help)
--touch-file: Touch (update) the file's date/time to match the actual date the photo was taken, not the date it was exported.
--download-missing: Download any missing photos from iCloud
--update: The first time you run the command this does nothing but if you run the command again, it will export only any new/modified photos, not the whole thing again.
